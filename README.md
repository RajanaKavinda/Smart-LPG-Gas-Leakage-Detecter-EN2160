# Smart-LPG-Gas-Leakage-Detecter-EN2160

This repo contains the project done by me during semester 4 as a part of the Electronic design realization module at ENTC University of Moratuwa.
In this individual project, I have developed an advanced LPG Gas Leakage Detector designed for both residential and commercial spaces. This innovative device utilizes cutting-edge sensing technology to swiftly identify gas leakages, activating an emergency alarm and sending real-time SMS alerts to the user's registered mobile phone for immediate response. Featuring a user-friendly OLED display and adaptable SMS configuration, this detector ensures continuous awareness of gas levels and offers a customizable, user-centric safety solution. With its emphasis on safety, efficiency, and user-friendliness, this project represents a significant step toward creating a secure environment for occupants.
